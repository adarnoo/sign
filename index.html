                  <li>Human beings have developed their intelligence, techniques
                   and knowledge for the most part through their empirical
                   abilities. Observing, experimenting, drawing conclusions,
                   adjusting and starting over, men have built tools, have
                   learned to master fire, to use plants and have constantly
                   improved those systems. Scientific research is based
                   today on a constant back and forth between experience and
                   analysis.</li>

                   <li>Hundred thousands years ago, human beings living on the
                   planet have all been confronted to birth and death, to the
                   cycle of seasons and stars, to rains and droughts. Facing
                   those events, they have looked for rational explanations
                   to better their knowledge of them and try to master
                   them or at least to influence their course. In spite of
                   infinite variations, most ancestral religions have in
                   common their polytheism.</li>

                   <li>Entities, often anthropomorphic ones, are endowed with
                   extraordinary powers; they govern the universe and embody
                   fundamental forces such as the sun, the night, the rain.
                   The will to give a form to those divinities, to mark
                   their sanctuaries, to devote objects to them and to keep
                   worshipping them, is what symbols partly stem from.</li>

                   <li>The creation of symbolic signs and writings indeed derives
                   from a need to render things tangible, to neutralize and tame them but also to identify and organize them. We know
                    for instance that Sumerian writing was created around
                    3300 BC to resolve the need to account for agricultural
                    production in order to determine the amount of taxes.Whether it originally stemmed from an administrative or
                    a religious necessity, symbolic vocabulary was deeply marked by the imprint of its natural environment. We had the intuition that the construction of symbolic forms, including abstract ones, happened in accordance with natural forms. That was confirmed by various researches in neurosciences. Chaingizi has shown that every alphabetical or ideogramatic sign has been elaborated in response
                    to natural forms. Interestingly, the area of the brain
                    triggered by reading is the same as the one enabling us
                    to identify natural forms. Dehaene has shown that the
                    shapes of letters do not stem only from arbitrary cultural
                    choices, but have been oriented by our capacity to
                    recognize the natural forms that surround us. If it leans
                    on preexisting neuronal competences, reading is all the
                    more efficient.</li>

                    <li>The oldest known traces of symbols date back 4000 years,
                    just like the first works of art. Ernst Cassirer has
                    studied language, myth, sciences and art as “symbolic
                    forms”. He has defined three types of such forms:</li>

                    <li class="ht-pop-up-italic">“Every symbolic form can be traced back according to
                    a process that goes from the “mimetic” stage to the
                    “analogical” stage to eventually rise to a purelymsymbolic
                    form. That process starts with an inclination towards the
                    object, then moves on to the subject and eventually to the
                    symbol.”</li>

                    <li>It is what we observe in the evolution of writings
                    throughout the world. They are firstly pictogramatic,
                    they move on to becoming ideograms and eventually end
                    up being formed of “purely abstract signs For instance,
                    in Egyptian hieroglyph water was made by one undulating
                    line a mimetic form. Borrowed by the Phoenician alphabet,
                    the sign evolved in mem, a term meaning “water.” It’s
                    an analogical approach in that letter / word / sound
                    corresponds perfectly. The mem then became (mu) in the
                    Greek alphabet, written M in capital letters, which is
                    part of the symbolic order according to Cassirer. The 9 evolution from drawing to symbolizing happens through
                    the evolution from a “literal” sense to a more abstract
                    one. This explains how, through epigraphy, we can trace
                    down a semantic connection, that we’ve lost through time,
                    between a geometric sign and its initial form. To make
                    this epigraphic investigation more thorough, we have
                    followed the path of various modern artists like Wassily
                    Kandinsky, Paul Klee or Joan Miro, whose researches on
                    the stylization of form up to the point of abstraction
                    have been fundamentally inspired by ancient cultures. We
                    studied this artistic process in parallel to that of the
                    creation of symbols.</li>

                  <li>Walter Benjamin put forward the thesis that not alone does translation operate between different languages, but that human language itself is generated by a translational process. Human language originally translated
                  nothing other than the language of things. While the function of language is generally seen to be one in which things, by being named, are transformed into objects that are communicable and therefore categorisable, Benjamin counters that this capacity is preceded by an act of reception. To hear the language of things and then translate it is a condition of any naming process. This type of perception, which cannot itself be based on the transmission of linguistic content, s made possible by human language’s capacity for imitation or mimesis. Rather than arguing for a concept of language as a purely arbitrary phenomenon, or asserting that it developed from onomatopoetic sounds alone, Benjamin maintains instead that the capacity of language to perceive and produce similarities has been the driving factor in its evolution. However dubious or fruitful such speculation on the oritgins of language might be considered, the thesis of language formation through translation
                  is significant in two respects. Firstly, Benjamin extends the concept of language to the language of things and, with this broader application of the idea, he introduces another conceptualization of language, referred to as “magical” by Benjamin himself. Secondly, by postulating receptiveness as the necessary antecedent to any articulation, he asserts the existence of a passive condition in human speech. The usual relationship between humanity (active) and the object world (passive), once it is reversed in this way,
                  is thus reinterpreted. The consequences of that re-articulation are as far reaching as they are worthy of consideration.</li>

                  a constructed written ideographic language intended to be universally readable only. As a concept-based language, all characters would be independent of spoken words. Charles Bliss (1897-1985) was born in Austria, and studied chemical engineering at Vienna University of Technology. After graduating he worked as a research chemist and later as chief of the patent department at an electronics company until the outbreak of war when he was sent to a Nazi concentration camp. Following his release in 1938 he moved to England until 1940, then to Shanghai where he was imprisoned as a prisoner-of-war, finally settling in Australia. It was whilst in Shanghai that he was exposed to the Chinese writing system which encouraged him to begin to devise ‘Semantography’ (or ‘Blissymbolics’), a universal symbol system that could
                  18 be translated into any language, and which he hoped would help to bring about world peace and to promote greater understanding between nations and cultures.</li>

                  <li>The first billboards as modern audiences would understand
                  them were, like many things, made of stone and created by ancient Egyptians. The purpose of the first known billboards
                  was not to advertise the first consumer products but to announce laws outside the city of Thebes in circa 1000 BCE. Unlike simpler forms of advertising, like posters and flyers which are intended to be viewed close up, billboards seek
                  to attract attention from further away. Ancient billboards required costly labor and resources that limited their use to important state business. As a result, billboards have
                  rarely been used throughout human history. The circumstances that allowed billboards to flourish in modern society required new technology along with a sudden explosion of consumer consumption.</li>

                  <li>As a concept, billboards are simple. They’re just a big board conveying a message. But their use requires a purpose and before the Industrial Revolution, only governments and rulers really had a need to communicate with large groups. Then Jared Bell had a need of his own. The explosion of commerce in the 19th century resulting from the steam engine and other innovations created much of our modern world. But it was the invention of lithography in the 1790s by Alous Senefelder allowing for the mass production of printed color flyers and posters that allowed for modern billboards. Jared Bell was an event promoter in 1830s New York seeking to drum up business for the Ringling Brothers Circus.</li>

                  <li>Though a standard billboard has remained largely unchanged since the 1830s (outdoor electric lighting was a big innovator
                  for the industry), advertisers do occasionally experiment with new tech in high profile areas. Times Square has long been the center for America’s premiere billboards. Due to its proximity to Broadway theaters, Times Square’s earliest prominent features were marquees advertising various performances. The showmanship of advertising in Times Square has often blurred the lines between billboards and massive sculptures.

                  <li>Human billboard is someone who applies an advertisement
                  on their person. Most commonly, this means holding
                  or wearing a sign of some sort, but also may include wearing advertising as clothing or in extreme cases, having advertising tattooed on the body. Sign holders are known as human directionals in the advertising industry, or colloquially as sign walkers, sign wavers, sign twirlers or (in British territories) sandwich men. Frequently, they will spin or dance or wear costumes with the promotional sign in order to attract attention. Human billboards have been used for centuries. In the 19th century London, the practice began when advertising posters became subject to a tax and competition for wall space became fierce. Prince Pückler-Muskau described the activity in 1820s London as</li>

                  <li>Furthermore, besides holding signs, some human billboards would wear sandwich boards. Charles Dickens described these advertisers as “a piece of human flesh between two slices of paste board.” It was claimed in The Times in mid- 1823 that such human billboards were a London invention while a familiar sight in London, the “biped advertisement” was new in Paris at that time. The banning of posters from private property in London in 1839 greatly increased the
                  use of human billboards. As the novelty of seeing humans carrying placards wore off, advertisers would come up with variations on the theme in order to catch the eye, such as having a “parade” of identical human billboards, or having the human billboards wear outrageous costumes. Human directionals are still widely used, especially in areas that have a lot of pedestrian traffic, but even in places that have
                  a great deal of automobile traffic. For the latter, the signs will frequently be shaped like arrows in order to direct traffic to the location being advertised. Eye Shot, a Lake Forest, California company claims to have invented modern sign spinning using arrow-shaped signs. The modern human directional employs a number of tricks to attract attention,
                  such as spinning the sign on one finger, throwing it up in
                  the air and spinning it, or even riding the sign like a horse. Another California company, AArrowSign Spinners, 47 conducts “boot camps” to train its employees, and has
                  also filed patent applications for a number of its “signature moves."</li>

                  <li>The newest trend is to have moving pictures on clothing. The first instance of this was done at the 2003 Rugby World Cup, where “Telstra girls” wore T-shirts outfitted with a small television screen and a DVD player, called “TelePAKs.” This was duplicated in the United States in 2004 with “Adver- Wear” “T-Shirt TV,” that made its debut advertising the film I, Robot. In 1999, Vibe magazine predicted that companies in the next millennium would pay people to get tattoos advertising their brands.</li>
