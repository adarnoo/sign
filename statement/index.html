                <li>My project investigates both the physical and idealogical properties of the term ‘sign,’ and explores the ways in which these findings can be presented together.</li>

                <li>I decided to showcase my research in the style of an ‘Object Book,’ after looking through multiple <a href="https://www.macguffinmagazine.com/" target="_blank">MacGuffin</a> magazines. I liked their approach of documenting a single concept and showcasing how far they could expand on it. I wanted my publication to do the same, yet not only focus on the physical qualities of a concept, but also the ideas that could go along with it. This led me to my four main sections being language, billboards, sign from above and road signs.</li>

                <li>From an aesthetic approach I looked at the publication <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwFgePfdeOI&ab_channel=VashgdSerif" target="_blank">In Alphabetical Order</a> by Stuart Bailey. I wanted to replicate its use of greyscale imagery and text throughout, with the exception of red annotations. I thought it was fitting as it emphasised the research part of the publication, which is the most important part.</li>

                <li>For my second outcome I wanted to layout everything I had collected in a totally different way. I approached building this website as an exploration of print, wanting the site to pull from the information and aesthetics of my publication, but showcase them in a more interactive and interesting way.</li>
